--------------Creating HTML file------------
A heading tag h1 used for heading="Calculator by Dheeraj Kumar."
A div container was taken with class="container".
inside the div container two div containers were taken with class="screen" and class="btn".
inside first div tag, input tag is used with id="screen".
inside second div tag, 10 div tags are used with id="row".
inside each row, 3 button tags are used with id="btn".


-------------Creating CSS file--------------
first body tag used for giving required margin,padding,display etc.
using h1 tag required styling was given to the heading.
using class container required padding,margin,height, box-radius,box shadow.
using display class and id screen the display of claculator is styled.
using class btn the button container is styled.
using class btn and row and button tag each button is styled giving all required css properties.
using eval ce and ac id the CE AC and = buttons are styled.
Now finally the website is made responsive using mediaquery.

-----------Creating JS file-----------------
<script> tag is used at the end of body tag for js.
 Using querySelector property we fetch the element of screen and btn. Now using addeventListner we make connection between screen and buttons.
 Now we use eval function for = button such that on pressing = button we get our required output on screen.
 for advanced calculation we make functions for each and every sin, cos, tan etc and use onclick property to execute that function for desired output.
